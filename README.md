# Image Analysis API using Azure Cognitive AI
## Why?

I wanted to develop a simplified version of the image analysis service offered by Microsoft Azure Cognitive AI, with the goal of enhancing accessibility.

The focus is on eliminating the complexity and hassle associated with configuring the service.

(And, of course, to impress my professor as this serves as my final project ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )

## Getting started
[Swagger](http://159.65.225.73:3000/docs/) documentation has been configured for this project and can be used to familiarize yourself with the API endpoints.

Alternatively, you can follow along to see how to use a tool like Postman to make the API calls.
