# Image Analysis API using Azure Cognitive AI
## Why? ü§î

I wanted to develop a simplified REST API which uses the image analysis service offered by [Microsoft Azure Cognitive AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis?tabs=3-2), with the goal of enhancing accessibility.

The focus is on eliminating the complexity and hassle associated with configuring the service.

(And, of course, to impress my professor as this serves as my final project ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø )

## Built Using üîß

- Microsoft Azure Cognitive AI (Version [3.2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/call-analyze-image?tabs=rest) and [4.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/call-analyze-image-40?pivots=programming-language-rest-api))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
- [image-size](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-size)

## Getting Started
Let's go!

[Swagger](http://159.65.225.73:3000/docs/) documentation has been configured for this project and can be used to familiarize yourself with the API endpoints.

Alternatively, you can follow along to see how to use a GUI tool like Postman to make the API calls.


### Prerequisites
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- That's it! :D

### Steps
1. Open Postman and create a new request.

2. Enter the base URL along with the required endpoint. Change the request type to POST.

3. Navigate to Body and select *form-data*. Now add the key as "image" and change type to *File* from *Text*

4. Click on *Select Files* under Value field and select an image (JPG, PNG, GIF, or BMP) from your system. Once selected, hit the Send button.

5. And voila! You've got your first API reponse! üéâ

![Voila!](https://i.imgur.com/Xnjreoy.png)

You can achieve the same result using CLI with the help of [cURL](https://curl.se/) like this:
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://159.65.225.73:3000/generate-caption' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'image=@/Users/aravind/Downloads/cat_compressed.gif;type=image/gif'
```
Just make sure to change the image path to that in your system and modify the type accordingly.

### Sample Response
```json
{
    "caption": {
        "text": "a cat lying on a blanket",
        "confidence": 0.7403799891471863
    },
    "metadata": {
        "width": 480,
        "height": 320
    }
}
```

| :--------: | :------- | :------- |
| 200 | OK | Congrats! Your API call went through just fine. |
| 400 | Bad Request | There's most likely an issue with the file you uploaded. Please check the limitations section to know more about supported file types. |
| 404 | Not Found | You'll get this error if you didn't send a file with your request. If you did, make sure the key is set to "image". |

## Limitations
- File format must be JPG, PNG, GIF, or BMP.
- Image resolution must be greater than 50x50 pixels and less than 16,000x16,000 pixels.
- File size must be within 4 megabytes (MB).
- Due to the current limitation in Azure free tier, the number of calls is limited to 10 per second.

### If you've reached till here, you're awesome! Thanks for taking the time to use my API üôåüèª
