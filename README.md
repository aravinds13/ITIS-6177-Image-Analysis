# Image Analysis API using Azure Cognitive AI
## Why? ü§î

I wanted to develop a simplified REST API which uses the image analysis service offered by [Microsoft Azure Cognitive AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis?tabs=3-2), with the goal of enhancing accessibility.

The focus is on eliminating the complexity and hassle associated with configuring the service.

(And, of course, to impress my professor as this serves as my final project ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø )

## Built using üîß

- Microsoft Azure Cognitive AI (Version [3.2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/call-analyze-image?tabs=rest) and [4.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/call-analyze-image-40?pivots=programming-language-rest-api))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
- [image-size](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-size)

## Getting started
Let's go!

[Swagger](http://159.65.225.73:3000/docs/) documentation has been configured for this project and can be used to familiarize yourself with the API endpoints.

Alternatively, you can follow along to see how to use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to make the API calls.


### Prerequisites
- Postman
- That's it! :D

### Steps
1. Open Postman and create a new request.

2. Enter the base URL along with the required endpoint. Change the request type to POST.
